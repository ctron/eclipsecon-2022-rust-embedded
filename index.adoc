== Who are we?

* Ulf Lilleengen (@lulf)
* Jens Reimann (@ctron)

Software Engineers @ Red Hat

== What do we do?

* Work on open source IoT
* Cloud & embedded
* With a focus on "Drogue IoT"

== Why Rust?

[%notitle]
=== Why Rust?

[quote, https://rust-lang.org]
A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

[%notitle]
=== Microsoft

[quote, Microsoft, A proactive approach to more secure code]
~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues

=== Meaning?

Those 70% would never have existed, if Rust had been used!

=== We can do better!

== Embedded Rust

[.text-left]
=== Embedded?

* 16 kB - 512 kB RAM
* 128 kB - 2 MB ROM/Flash
* No operating system
* No memory allocator

[.text-left]
=== A working group

* Rust Embedded
* Official working group of the Rust language
* Community to collaborate on Rust embedded topics

[.text-left]
=== Rust compiler

* ARM (Cortex-M)
** STM32
** nRF (micro:bit)
** Raspberry Pi Pico
* RISC-V
** ESP32 C3
* …

[.notes]
--
* First thing, we need a compiler
* Rust offers compilers for different embedded architectures out of the box
* But that doesn't give you any functionality yet
--

=== Layers

image:images/rust_layers.svg[Rust embedded layers]

[.notes]
--
* Second step: we need to build something on top of the compiler
* Mainly hardware abstraction and drivers
* So that we can build applications
* Some PACs and HALs come from the Rust embedded WG
--

[.text-left]
=== Creating applications

* Plain Rust
* RTIC
* Embassy

[.notes]
--
* First there was plain Rust
* This was used in the 2019 example, combined with FreeRTOS from the ESP-IDF
* In order to support an easier development model with interrupts, RTIC was created
* But then came `async` and changed the landscape of Rust
--

== Async Rust

[.notes]
--
What is async Rust? And how does it help in the context of "embedded"?
--

=== Without async

[.column]
[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let mut button = Button::new();
    let mut led = Led::new();
    loop {
        if button.is_pressed() {
            led.on();
        } else {
            led.off();
        }
    }
}
----

* Inefficient (busy looping)

=== Using interrupts

[.column]
[source,rust]
----
static BUTTON: Mutex<Option<Button>> = Mutex::new(None);
static LED: Mutex<Option<Led>> = Mutex::new(None);
fn main() {
    LED.lock().replace(Led::new());
    BUTTON.lock().replace(Button::new());
    setup_irq(button_event); // Magic
}

fn button_event() {
    if BUTTON.lock().as_mut().unwrap().is_pressed() {
        LED.lock().as_mut().unwrap().on();
    } else {
        LED.lock().as_mut().unwrap().off();
    }
}
----

* Complex!

=== Using async

[.column]
[source,rust]
----
async fn main() {
    let mut button = Button::new();
    let mut led = Led::new();
    loop {
        button.wait_changed().await;
        if button.is_pressed() {
            led.on();
        } else {
            led.off();
        }
    }
}
----

* Interrupt handling internally
* Efficient - executor puts app to sleep on await points


=== Async executor

Rust requires an "executor" to drive async workload.

[.text-left]
=== Tokio

* Async executor for `std`
* Builds on top of an I/O loop

=== Bare metal vs standard library

image:images/no_std.png[Bare metal Rust]

[.notes]
--
* "std" means: standard library
* std requires a posix like operating systems, or windows
* "core" requires at lot less, but doesn't even have dynamic memory
* "alloc" brings dynamic memory, but it is optional
* not having "std" is often named "no_std"
--

[.left]
=== Embassy

EMBedded ASYnc

* An executor for embedded Rust, supporting `no_std`.
* Async synchronization primitives, time keeping
* HALs for nRF, STM32 and RP2040
* Bootloader
* USB, TCP/IP, LoRa and BLE

[.notes]
--
* Rust "async" need an executor to drive async workload
* In "std", common executors are Tokio or "async-std"
--

[.text-left]
=== Embassy & friends

[.notes]
--
Embassy can be combined with other async Rust components.
--

* Drivers from crates.io
* Ector
* Drogue Device
* …

[.text-left]
=== Ector

An actor framework.

[.text-left]
=== Drogue Device

Distribution of Embassy focused on a few boards supporting IoT, OTA updates.

=== Why RTOS?
